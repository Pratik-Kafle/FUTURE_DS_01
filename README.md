# 🛒 Superstore Analytical Dashboard – Internship Project
## Introduction
Retail data is full of stories about customers, products, and performance. 
During my **Data Science & Analytics internship** at *FutureIntern*, I built this Power BI dashboard 
to explore Superstore sales data. The dashboard highlights three perspectives that are Executive Summary, 
Product Insight, and Customer Insight for helping stakeholders quickly understand growth trends, 
regional performance, and customer behavior.
